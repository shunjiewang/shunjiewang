### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I study Natural Language Processing, with a side interest in speech processing. My interests include conversational AI, as well as theory and formalism in NLP. 

As a linguist, I care about phonology of Sinitic languages and languages of China at large, as well as Sino-Xenic pronunciations.
